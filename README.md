## Aperture Archery Puzzle Game ðŸŽ¯ðŸ”¬

A Portal-inspired physics puzzle game set in a sterile Aperture-like test facility.
Instead of portals, you wield an experimental modular bow that fires a variety of high-tech arrows, each altering the environment in creative, puzzle-solving ways.

# Experimental Bow & Arrow Types

- Explosion Arrow â€“ blast obstacles & launch objects with shockwaves.

- Bridge Arrow â€“ create temporary Hard Light bridges across gaps.

- Fly Arrow â€“ generate upward lift fields (like Excursion Funnels).

- Teleport Arrow â€“ instantly warp to the arrowâ€™s location.

- Repulsion Arrow â€“ create bounce-pad surfaces (Repulsion Gel style).

- Tractor Arrow â€“ project horizontal tractor beams to carry objects or the player.

- Phase Arrow â€“ phase through solid walls temporarily for one-way traversal.

# Puzzle-First Gameplay

- Multi-step puzzles requiring arrow combinations.

- Momentum-based traversal challenges.

- Environmental manipulation instead of combat.

Developed with Unreal Engine 5
